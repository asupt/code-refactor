# What is the Code-Refactor Challenge Assignment?

## This assignment assesses our understanding of semantic elements within HTML and our ability to provide appropriate context to make the project website as accessible and optimized for search engines as possible, as well as our ability to consolidate classes where possible to achieve a concise and effective CSS file.

## Git skills are also examined - it is important to make frequent and descriptive updates to improve QoL of collaboration.
